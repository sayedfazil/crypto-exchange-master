                  electronically or in physical form, confidential or
                  proprietary information, or information of a competitively
                  sensitive nature, whether marked or unmarked, concerning the
                  Disclosing Party or its Affiliates or agents, or the Service,
                  in connection with this Agreement (together, “<strong
                    >Confidential Information</strong
                  >”).  Confidential Information of each party includes, without
                  limitation, business plans, company relationships, acquisition
                  plans, systems architecture, information systems, computer
                  programs and codes, processes, methods, operational
                  procedures, finances, budgets, policies and procedures,
                  product plans, projections, analyses, plans or results, and
                  any other information which is normally and reasonably
                  considered confidential.  Each party agrees that during the
                  term of this Agreement and thereafter: (a) it will use
                  Confidential Information belonging to the Disclosing Party in
                  accordance with this Agreement and for the sole purpose of
                  this Agreement; and (b) except as necessary to perform its
                  obligations under the Agreement, it will not disclose
                  Confidential Information belonging to the Disclosing Party to
                  any third party (other than the Receiving Party’s employees,
                  contractors and/or professional advisors on a need-to-know
                  basis who are subject to obligations of nondisclosure and
                  limited use at least as stringent as those contained herein)
                  without first obtaining the Disclosing Party’s written
                  consent.  The Receiving Party shall exercise the same degree
                  of care with the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information
                  as it exercises with its own confidential and proprietary
                  information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of
                  care.  Upon request by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving
                  Party will return all copies of any Confidential Information
                  to the Disclosing Party.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Confidentiality Exclusions</strong>.  For purposes
                  hereof, Confidential Information will not include any
                  information that the Receiving Party can establish: (a) was
                  previously known by the Receiving Party; (b) was independently
                  developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference
                  to any Confidential Information belonging to the Disclosing
                  Party; (c) was acquired by the Receiving Party from a third
                  party having the legal right to furnish same to the Receiving
                  Party without disclosure restrictions; or (d) was at the time
                  in question (whether at disclosure or thereafter) generally
                  known by or available to the public (through no fault of the
                  Receiving Party).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Required Disclosures</strong>.  Nothing herein shall
                  prevent a Receiving Party from disclosing any Confidential
                  Information as necessary pursuant to any court order, lawful
                  requirement of a governmental agency or when disclosure is
                  required by operation of law (including disclosures pursuant
                  to any applicable securities laws and regulations); provided
                  that prior to any such disclosure, the Receiving Party shall
                  use reasonable efforts to (a) to the extent permitted by law,
                  promptly notify the Disclosing Party in writing of such
                  requirement to disclose and (b) cooperate with the Disclosing
                  Party in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure
                  or obtaining a protective order. ​ Once there is alignment
                  across all parties, both the Disclosing party and the
                  Receiving party undertake to cooperate with all competent
                  authorities, including any other persons designated by them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong>  The parties acknowledge
                  and agree that the disclosure of Confidential Information may
                  result in irreparable harm for which there is no adequate
                  remedy at law.  The parties therefore agree that the
                  Disclosing Party may be entitled to seek an injunction in the
                  event the Receiving Party violates or threatens to violate the
                  provisions of this Section 12, and that no bond will be
                  required.  This remedy will be in addition to any other remedy
                  available at law or equity.

                  <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong>  This Agreement (including
                  the Service Terms) constitutes the entire agreement, and
                  supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or
                  agreements (oral or written), between the parties regarding
                  the subject matter of this Agreement (and all past dealing or
                  industry custom).  Any inconsistent or additional terms on any
                  related purchase order, confirmation or similar form, even if
                  signed by the parties hereafter, shall have no effect under
                  this Agreement.  In the event of any conflict between the
                  terms of this Agreement and the Service Terms, the Service
                  Terms shall control.  This Agreement supersedes any vendor
                  forms, order forms, invoices, policies, or other terms and
                  conditions provided by ZeroEx.  This Agreement may be executed
                  in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be an
                  original, but taken together constituting one and the same
                  instrument.  Execution of a electronic copy shall have the
                  same force and effect as execution of an original, and an
                  electronic signature shall be deemed an original and valid
                  signature.  The failure of either party to enforce its rights
                  under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be
                  construed as a waiver of such rights, and the exercise of one
                  right or remedy will not be deemed a waiver of any other right
                  or remedy.  If any provision of this Agreement is determined
                  to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited
                  or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this
                  Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
                  enforceable.  This Agreement is in English only, which
                  language shall be controlling in all respects.

                  <strong>Modifications.</strong>  ZeroEx reserves the right to
                  modify or update this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any
                  time in its sole discretion.  ZeroEx will use commercially
                  reasonable efforts to notify Licensee of any material changes
                  in advance of the effective date of any such change.
                   Licensee’s continued use of the Service following any such
                  change will constitute Licensee’s acceptance of such changes.
                   This Agreement may not otherwise be amended, except by a
                  written agreement executed by ZeroEx and Licensee.

                <li>
                  <strong>Governing Law.</strong>  This Agreement shall be
                  governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
                  State of California, USA, without regard to its conflicts of
                  law provisions.  Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any
                  action arising under this Agreement shall be in the federal
                  and state courts located in San Francisco, California, and
                  both parties hereby consent to such jurisdiction and venue for
                  this purpose.  In any action to enforce its rights under this
                  Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
                  costs and attorneys’ fees.  Neither the United Nations
                  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
                  nor the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall
                  apply to this Agreement.

                  <strong>Remedies.</strong>  Licensee acknowledges that any
                  breach of this Agreement by it or its employees or agents will
                  give rise to irreparable injury to ZeroEx and not adequately
                  compensated by damages.  Accordingly, ZeroEx will be entitled
                  to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific
                  performance against any breach or threatened breach of this
                  Agreement, in addition to any other legal remedies that may be
                  available.  Except as specifically provided otherwise herein,
                  each right and remedy in this Agreement is in addition to any
                  other right or remedy, at law or in equity.

                  <strong>Notices.</strong>  All notices under this Agreement
                  will be in writing, in English and delivered to the parties at
                  their respective addresses stated herein or at such other
                  address designated by written notice.  Notices will be deemed
                  to have been duly given when received, if personally
                  delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if
                  transmitted by email; the day after being sent, if sent for
                  next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service; or
                  upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail, return
                  receipt requested.

                  <strong>Force Majeure.</strong>  In the event that either
                  party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform,
                  any of its obligations under this Agreement (except payment
                  obligations) due to any cause beyond its reasonable control
                  including, without in any way limiting the generality of the
                  foregoing, fire, explosion, earthquake, storm, flood, strike,
                  war, insurrection, riot, act of God or the public enemy,
                  pandemics, epidemics, local disease outbreaks, public health
                  emergencies, quarantines, failures in any telecommunications,
                  network or other service or equipment that are not within a
                  party’s reasonable control, unauthorized access, breach of
                  firewalls or other hacking by third parties, instructions of
                  government or other public authorities, or judgment or decree
                  of a court of competent jurisdiction (not arising out of
                  breach by such party of this Agreement), the affected party’s
                  performance shall be excused or extended for the period of
                  delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence.

                  obligations hereunder, or Licensee’s account used to access
                  the Service, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise)
                  without ZeroEx’s prior written consent. ZeroEx may transfer,
                  assign, or delegate this Agreement and its rights and
                  obligations without consent.  This Agreement shall be binding
                  upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors,
                  representatives and permitted assigns of each party hereto.
