                  >Please read the following section carefully because it
                  requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with
                  ZeroEx and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from
                  us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the
                  instructions set forth below. In addition, arbitration
                  precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. You
                  and ZeroEx agree that any dispute arising out of or related to
                  these Terms or our Services is personal to you and ZeroEx and
                  that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual
                  action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class
                  action or any other type of representative proceeding. Except
                  for small claims disputes in which you or ZeroEx seeks to
                  bring an individual action in small claims court located in
                  the county or other applicable jurisdiction where you reside
                  or disputes in which you or ZeroEx seeks injunctive or other
                  equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual
                  property, you and ZeroEx waive your rights to a jury trial and
                  to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms
                  or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or
                  claim that you have against ZeroEx or relating in any way to
                  the Services, you agree to first contact ZeroEx and attempt to
                  resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of
                  your claim (“</span
                ><span class="supporting-text-16">Notice</span
                ><span class="desktop-mobile-body-l-slim"

                ><span class="desktop-mobile-body-l-slim"
                  >. The Notice must include your name, residence address, email
                  address, and telephone number, describe the nature and basis
                  of the claim and set forth the specific relief sought. Our
                  notice to you will be similar in form to that described above.
                  If you and ZeroEx cannot reach an agreement to resolve the
                  claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received,
                  then either party may submit the dispute to binding
                  arbitration administered by the JAMS, or, under the limited
                  circumstances set forth above, in court. All disputes
                  submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential,
                  binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration
                  proceedings will be held in California, in accordance with the
                  JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (“</span
                ><span class="supporting-text-16">JAMS Rules</span
                ><span class="desktop-mobile-body-l-slim"
                  >”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available
                  on the JAMS Site and are hereby incorporated by reference. You
                  either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand
                  the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS
                  Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or
                  should not apply for any reason. You and ZeroEx agree that the
                  enforceability of this Section 12 will be substantively and
                  procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
                  § 1, et seq. (the “</span
                ><span class="supporting-text-16">FAA</span
                ><span class="desktop-mobile-body-l-slim"
                  >”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As
                  limited by the FAA, these Terms and the AAA Rules, the
                  arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all
                  procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and
                  to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in
                  court, including the power to determine the question of
                  arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual
                  arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s
                  claims, preside over any type of class or representative
                  proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than
                  one individual. The arbitrator, ZeroEx, and you will maintain
                  the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments
                  and awards, including, but not limited to, all information
                  gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the
                  arbitration or related to the disputes. The arbitrator will
                  have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard
                  confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The
                  duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that
                  disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the
                  arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court
                  application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a
                  judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement,
                  or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law
                  or judicial decision. You and ZeroEx agree that for any
                  arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and
                  ZeroEx will pay the remaining AAA fees and costs. For any
                  arbitration initiated by ZeroEx, ZeroEx will pay all AAA fees
                  and costs. You and ZeroEx agree that the courts of Grand
                  Cayman sitting in the Cayman Islands have exclusive
                  jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an
                  arbitration award. Any claim arising out of or related to
                  these Terms or our Services must be filed within one year
                  after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently
                  barred, which means that you and ZeroEx will not have the
                  right to assert the claim. You have the right to opt out of
                  binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first
                  accepted the terms of this Section 12 by emailing us at </span

                  your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to
                  opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding
                  arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in
                  accordance with Section 12. If any portion of this Section 12
                  is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the
                  unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these
                  Terms, severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision
                  will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this
                  Section 12 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of
                  any remaining claims on an individual basis under this Section
                  12, and to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed
                  on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis,
                  such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent
                  jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree
                  that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the
                  outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if
                  any part of this Section 12 is found to prohibit an individual
                  claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will
                  have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be
                  sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section
                  12 will be enforceable.</span
