              have read it and whether you have clicked on any links in that

              email campaigns, make the emails we send to you more relevant to
              your interests and to understand if you have opened and read any
              important administrative emails we might send you. Most popular
              email clients will allow you to block these pixels by disabling
              certain external images in emails. You can do this through the
              settings on your email client – these generally give you the
              option of choosing whether emails will display &quot;remote
              images&quot;, &quot;remote content&quot; or &quot;images&quot; by
              default. Some browsers also give you the option of downloading and
              installing extensions that block pixels and other tracking
